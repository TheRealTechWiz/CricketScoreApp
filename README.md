# cricket-score-prediction-for-batsman-and-wickets-for-bowlers
Here in this project, we are trying to predict the performance of a paricular player in a cricket match based on his prevous performance. Here we used various machine learning techniques to classify the performance of players in 5 categories bounding the range in which the player will score runs or take wickets. we have planned to deploy this model using mobile application to give user a nice experience.
